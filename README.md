Project Overview: UK Fire Statistics (2010-2023)

Objective:
This project aimed to conduct a comprehensive analysis of fire incidents in the UK from 2010 to 2023. The primary objectives were to identify properties at risk, examine the effects of these incidents on individuals, and propose mitigation strategies.

Scope:
The analysis delved into critical fire records, including the intent of fire, alarm systems, casualties, fatalities, and the level of property damage. The goal was to derive insights that illuminate the landscape of fire incidents in the UK and suggest effective mitigation measures.

Methodology:
Data for this project was sourced from the UK Government website, and Microsoft Excel served as the primary analytical tool. The methodology included data extraction, Power Pivot for data modeling (refer to the figure below), and the use of pivot tables to unveil meaningful patterns and trends within the dataset.

Outcome:
The project's outcome is visualized through the attached dashboard and accompanying data model. The analysis provides a nuanced understanding of UK fire statistics, offering valuable insights for policymakers, emergency responders, and the general public.
